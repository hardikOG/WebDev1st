<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a second-year student at SRM Kattankulathur, passionate about both technology and business. My focus is on excelling in areas like coding, AI/ML, and DSA, while exploring business and trading. I aim to be in the top 1% of my field by taking a practical, step-by-step approach to mastering new skills.</p>
<p>Outside of academics, I stay active with gym workouts, cricket, and badminton. I also practice kriya sadhna for mental clarity and enjoy singing and philosophical thinking. My goal is to innovate in the tech world, potentially through a startup, while keeping ahead of emerging trends.</p>
